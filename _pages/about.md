Dongxie Wen is currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhewei Wei](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/zhewei). Prior to this, he received his B.Sc. degree in Mathematical Statistics from the School of Statistics at Renmin University of China in June 2023.


# Research Interests
My research centers on Sketch4ML, where I focus on designing memory- and computationally-efficient data structures tailored for a variety of learning paradigms. My broader research interests encompass efficient reinforcement learning, online learning, and unlearning. I am also deeply engaged in exploring the complexity and lower bounds of streaming algorithms.
